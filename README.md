In this assignment, you will enhance the application you developed in assignment #1 and #2 such that the objects will be created in and retrieved from an SQLite database. For this enhancement, you should at least do the following: 


1.	Define the tables: Student and CourseEnrollment table  

2.	Add the below logic when the application is started

-	Create a SQLite database if it does not exist or open the database if it already exists

-	Create the above tables if they do not exist 

-	Use Android SQLite API to query the database and convert the result set into a set of Java Student objects, which will be used to initialize the Adapter object. 

3.	When the users click the ‘Add Student’ menu item, the application will insert a record into the Student table and possibly several records into the CourseEnrollment table.
